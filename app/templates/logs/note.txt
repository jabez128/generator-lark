Lark generator NOTE:

Since lark generator can not create empty directories, this file is used to gerenate directory './logs' under the path of the app generated by lark.
By default, outputs of stdout and stderr will be print in './logs/node.log', which is configured in './config/bootstrap.json'.

If you changed that config, and print all you logs under other directories, feel free to delete this directory ^_^.
